What and which order you need to learn? 

Sys Admin 
Developer 
Tester 
Network Eng. 
Little IT 

What is DevOps skillset ?
Software development basics 
How developers work

Understand the software development lifecycle 

Idea 
Implement 
Test
Build 
Deploy 
Observe 

Software Deployment 
Servers 
Provision and prepare infrastructure 
Maintain
OS and Linux Basics 
Virtualization 
Networking 
On-premise and on cloud environment 


Containers 
Docker 
Container Orchestration / Kubernetes 

Learn one of the most popular cloud services 
AWS
Microsoft Azure 
Google Cloud 


CI / CD
Developed to Deploy 

Repository ( Git or Github ) 
Run Tests 
Build Docker Image 
Push to artifact repository 
Deploy 
Functional tests 
Regression tests
Security tests 
Performance tests 

CI/CD 
Jenkins 
Github actions 
Circleci
Gitlab CD /CD 

Monitoring and Observability 
Infrastructure Monitoring 
Application Monitoring 

Automation 
CI /CD automates all manual human tasks to get new code from commit into production 
Execute automated tests
Automate security tests 
Automatically build and package app 
Automatically deploy application 

Automation 
Infrastructure as a code  
IaC Use code to provision and manage infrastructure 
Easy replicate 
Development / Testing / Production 
Benefits of IaC 
Better Collaboration
Documentation 
Transparency of infra state 
Infrastructure Provisioning / Terraform 
Configuration management / Ansible 

BootCamp 
Operating Systems - Linux 
CI /CD - Jenkins 
Container - Docker 
Version Control - Gitlab 
Cloud IaaS - AWS 
Container Orchestration - Kubernetes 
Build Tools - npm 
Infrastructure Provisioning - Terraform 
Configuration Management - Ansible 
Artifact Repository Manage
Scripting Programing - Python 
Monitoring 


Zero - Starting point is different from person to person 
Sys Admin / Software Developer / Test Engineer / Network Engineer / No IT Background 


Starting as a System Administrator 
Set up Infrastructure 
Configure and Prepare for Deployment 
Work with Operating Systems 
Install and Configure Software on it 
Configure Networking and Ensure Security  through Firewalls, Backups, etc
Database Administration 
Network Administration 
Security Administration 
Day 0 = Initial Setup 
Day 1 = Maintaining and Operating 
Scripting Knowledge helps in automation 
Need to learn software development basics, 
How app is configured,
Testing 
Version Control ( Git ) 
Build Tools 
Then, start with the DevOps Technologies 
You do not program the application 
Create automated processes for delivering the developed software 


Starting as a Software Developer 
You Know All the Software Development Process 

Server Management Skills ( No Skills ) 

Virtual Machines 
Create and Configure Servers 
Configure Security
Networking 
Cloud and IaaS Basics 
How to Run Apps in Containers 
Run Containers in Kubernetes ( K8s ) 
CI / CD 

Programming Skills will help immensely in writing automation scripts 


Starting as a Test Automation Engineer
Less Pre-Requisites Knowledge 
You Know How Software Developers Work 
Understand Different Testing Scopes 
How to test different aspects of an app 

Repository ( Git or Github ) 
Run Tests 
Build Docker Image 
Push to artifact repository 

Test Automation Engineer

Deploy to PROD 
To Automatically Deliver Code Changes to PROD, you Need Extensive Automated Testing
  
Your Testing Framework and Basic Programming Skills will definitely help in automating some DevOps Processes


Starting as a Network Engineer
Configure Networking for Infrastructure 
On Premise 
Cloud 
Easy for you to Understand Networking in VMs, Containers, etc
Docker 
Kubernetes   
Scripting Skills will be Useful in DevOps Automation 
Bash 
Python


OS and Linux Module 
Os Basics
Virtualization 
Package Manager 
Working with Vim Editor
Users and Permissions 
Linux File System 
Linux Commands
Shell Scripting 
Networking 
SSH - Secure Shell 

Gain the necessary foundation for learning how to 
Provision Deployment Servers
Configure Servers 
Administer DevOps Tool 

Sys Admin 
Network Eng. 
Version Control with Git Module 
Build and Package Manager Tools 
Programming Basics ( Python ) 
Linux 
Version Control - Gitlab 
Cloud IaaS - AWS 
Container Orchestration - Kubernetes 
Build Tools - npm 
Infrastructure Provisioning - Terraform 
Configuration Management - Ansible 
Artifact Repository Manage
Scripting Programing - Python 
Monitoring 

Starting with no or little IT Background 


Automating Processes that were done Manually 
Understanding Complete Software Development Lifecycle 
Developing 
Packaging 
Testing 
Deploying 

How Software Development Teams Collaborate 
Learn DevOps Pre-Requisites ( Covered in DevOps Bootcamp ) 

Summary 
DevOps Roadmap
Getting the Pre- Requisites right
